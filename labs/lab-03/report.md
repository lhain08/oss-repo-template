## Gitstats
Gitstats picked up on a few things that somehow were not visible via the command line. For example, it detected an additional contributor that did not appear for me when reading the list of contributors.
This was an interesting tool for analyzing the lifespan of a project and I am interested to use it on some projects of my own.

## Gource
