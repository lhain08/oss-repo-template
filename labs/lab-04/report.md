# Lab 4 - Licensing
## License
This document is licensed by a [Creative Commons License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode).

## Why should you choose a license?
Choosing a license outlines the requirements for use and extension of the software. This ensures users know the criteria for use of the software and protects the intellectual property of the original creator.

## Why is it important that you shouldn't use an unlicensed project?
When a project is not licensed, the owner of the project is not giving explicit permission to use the project. As such, it is possible to misuse the code and violate the code's copyright.

## Failure to follow the Open System Model
Releasing early in the development process is a good choice for open source development. Where the purpose of developing open source is to engage a community of developers, the sooner the project is available for extension, the better. While it may be easier to gain collaborators with a fully developed project, the sooner you can bring others on board, the better.

## Justification for Android's Apache 2.0 License
In reading the differentiation between Apache, MIT, and GPL, according to [a blog post on Exygy](https://www.exygy.com/blog/which-license-should-i-use-mit-vs-apache-vs-gpl), Apache was highly permissible while maintaining specificity for the purposes of combatting lawsuits. This is good for a widely distributed software that is more liable to be extended by outside developers.
